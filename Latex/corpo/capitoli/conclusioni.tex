\lvli{Conclusion}
This work described the realization of a brand new PAT system for QKD experiments. Using the new QKD software structure along with the PAT repository system, the new version of PATSW was designed with the aim of providing a clear and easy-to-use system. The initial objectives were well achieved. Now the system has:
\begin{itemize}
  \item a brand new reliable software with a modular structure;
  \item the possibility to set many different parameters for improved exibility to different scenarios;
  \item a new board to optimize the center of the KPA101.
\end{itemize}
Both PATSW and PATHW new features have been developed, implemented and
successfully tested on the field. Tests have shown that the system allows excellent performance thanks to its independence from the physical hardware. It easily adapts to 25 Hz frame rate cameras to 200 Hz frame rate cameras. The system has also shown great adaptability with actuators where movements vary from a few milliseconds to seconds. Another example of the excellent hardware independence can be seen in the fiber injection experiment where three instances of the same program were used for coarse alignment of Alice and Bob and for fine alignment of Bob.

Furthermore, the system offers a great potential for the implementation of further
features and facilities. Future developments could expand the system functionality easily thanks to the help of ready-to-use documentation.
