\lvli{Introduction}
The aim of this thesis is to present an alignment system for quantum communication. To do this, the following chapters will be developed:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Quantum key distribution}: This chapter will explain a method of quantum communication called quantum key distribution;
  \item \textbf{Pointing Acquisition Tracking system}: This chapter will explain why quantum key distribution needs an alignment system and what its main components are;
  \item \textbf{QKD software design}:This chapter will explain the methods and technologies used to implement the software in this thesis;
  \item \textbf{PAT software design}: This chapter will explain how it was decided to create the software that controls the quantum key distribution alignment system using the technologies and methods discussed in the previous chapter;
  \item \textbf{PATLIC experiment}: This chapter will present a practical implementation of the alignment system;
  \item \textbf{Conclusions}: This chapter will summarize the points developed at the time and future extensions of the project.
\end{itemize}
