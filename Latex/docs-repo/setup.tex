\lvlv{Import}

Import as an external library into your project by copy-paste the
following lines in your \texttt{config.json}.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=javascript, gobble=2]
  {
    "name"     : "PATSetup",
    "path"     : "gitlab.dei.unipd.it/PAT/Setup.git",
    "tag"      : "HEAD",
    "available": "YES",
    "getGui"   : "NO"
  }
\end{lstlisting}

\lvlv{Prerequisites}
The Prerequisites are the same descibed in the section "Setup your enviroment Prerequisites" \sect{Setup your environment} with the addition of the following libraries that are auto fetched from the gitlab.dei.unipd.it:

\begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
        \href{https://gitlab.dei.unipd.it/PAT/Controller.git}{Controller}
        HEAD
\end{itemize}


\lvliv{Usage}
In this repo you can create your own GUI for the PAT system in the
\texttt{apps} folder. As reference you can use one of the already
defined apps. There is no need to explain additional things because in
this repository you want to compose ready-made pieces and not create new
ones. To simplify your orientation, you can find a global image of all the repositories in the picture \fig{Setup}.
