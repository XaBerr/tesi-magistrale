\lvliv{Adding new classes to the src folder}

In the \texttt{src/CMakeLists.txt} add the source and header (only the
headers not exported in the library) files in the \textbf{add\_library}
function. If you want the class to be exported in the library, so that
an external program can use it, put the header in the
\texttt{include/ProjName} folder.


\lvliv{Adding new classes to gui folder (should not be necessary
  but why not)}

In the \texttt{gui/CMakeLists.txt} add the source and header (only the
headers not exported in the library) files in the \textbf{add\_library}
function. If you want the class to be exported in the library, so that
an external program can use it, put the header in the
\texttt{include/ProjName/gui} folder.


\lvliv{Adding new executables to the apps folder}

In the \texttt{apps/CMakeLists.txt} add the \textbf{add\_executable}
function to create a new target executable:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=c++]
  add_executable(
  "${PROJECT_NAME}NewApp"
  newapp.cpp
  )
\end{lstlisting}

Also add the libraries that should be linked to the ``NewApp'' with
target\emph{link}libraries:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=c++]
  target_link_libraries(
    "${PROJECT_NAME}NewApp"
    PRIVATE Qt5::Gui Qt5::Widgets "${PROJECT_NAME}Gui" ${PROJECT_NAME} ${SUBMODULES_NAME}
  )
\end{lstlisting}
